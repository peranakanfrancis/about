    title: My Bio
    summary: |
      My name is Francis, born in Sabah and raised in Bukit Mertajam. Since very young age of 9 I have been sent out to boarding schools in Melaka & Ipoh. I completed form 5 studies at Bukit Mertajam, without the chance of further my study in college I took up a job offer abroad in Macau for 1.5 years. To be honest, I was a lost sheep
      due to giving in to drug addiction at the age of 22, it took me almost 12 years to get out from the circle. God made miracles. Thus, my life was blank for many years. Up until 3 years ago (April 2019) after I was miraculously saved by a dream, I woke up and gave up the toxicful lifestyle and started a slightly different one but
      I was only able back to work last year in a jewellery shop. The reason being was because I got into another deep situation - I got suffered in a very difficult time of my life which I got oppressed by the unclean spirits so I could't really work as a normal person for quite some time. My health dropped and mentally afflicted immersely that
      I could only work at home. After a year of recovery both in pysically, mentally and spiritually (thanks to many sisters and my parish priest Fr Louis who help me a lot) too. Since sister recomended to go for it and I'm also interested to learn to serve the Lord, so I decided to give this position a try. I have a passion of sharing the
      Gospel but I need guidance. I can work under supervision and stress. I have a lot of uneasy and ugly past that made me very hard to open up to people but since it is an offer from the church, so I wanted to be honest and hopefully you can see the good in me. Thanks.
